// The spreading factor is the most important parameter to set for a single channel
// gateway. It specifies the speed/datarate in which the gateway and node communicate.
// As the name says, in principle the single channel gateway listens to one channel/frequency
// and to one spreading factor only.
// This parameters contains the default value of SF, the actual version can be set with
// the webserver and it will be stored in SPIFF
// NOTE: The frequency is set in the loraModem.h file and is default 868.100000 MHz.

// Channel Activity Detection
// This function will scan for valid LoRa headers and determine the Spreading 
// factor accordingly. If set to 1 we will use this function which means the 
// 1-channel gateway will become even more versatile. If set to 0 we will use the
// continuous listen mode.
// Using this function means that we HAVE to use more dio pins on the RFM95/sx1276
// device and also connect enable dio1 to detect this state.
